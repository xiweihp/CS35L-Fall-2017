1.
 emacs hw9.txt

2.
 jump to diffutils repo
 and use the command:
 git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'
 
 Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3. Install change into this new branch
 patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. Learn add-change-log-entry-other-window
C-x 4 a adds a new entry to the change log file for the file you are editing

5.
open Emacs:
 emacs
 C-x 4 a
 open the git-log to see the previous log this and copy paste the related:

2017-12-03  Xiwei Ma  <classxiw@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
        This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
        which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
        `like this' or ``like this''.
        * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
        * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value, compare_files):
        * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage, read_diff):
        * src/dir.c (compare_names):
	* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
        * src/util.c (finish_output):
        Quote 'like this' in output.

C-x C-c to quit. Saved as ChangeLog

6. Commit
Simply use the command:

git commit -aF ChangeLog

 6 files changed, 43 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)


7. generate a file formatted-patch.txt
 use the command:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt


8. Verify that your partner's patch works
partner: Jiayu Zhao
copy her patch formatted-patch-jy.txt into lnxsrv.
create a temporary branch partner:

git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

Then use:

git am formatted-patch-jy.txt
Applying: 2017-12-02 Jiayu Zhao <classial@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

worked fine.
test using:

./src/diff . -

./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

And use:
./src/diff --help > check.txt

using Emacs, check there is no ` in output.

9. check MakeLog
Use the commands:

make distdir
ls

find and jump to the created directory:
cd diffutils-3.0.1-e5b4

open use Emacs:
emacs ChangeLog

And I saw her log:
2017-12-03  Jiayu Zhao  <classial@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        2017-12-02 Jiayu Zhao <classial@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

The ChangeLog worked.

10.
Open a terminal in xquartz.

ssh -Y classxiw@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

and then use the command:
gitk

A new window popped up.

Find the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25:
and it is:

Merge branch 'master' into xwidget on 2015-01-25 12:19:27

Took a screen shot and renamed it as gitk-screenshot.png.
